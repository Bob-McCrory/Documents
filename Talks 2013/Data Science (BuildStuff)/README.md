Doing Data Science with F# (BuildStuff 2013)
--------------------------------------------

To run the samples, open the solution in the `code` folder and build the solution (for the first time) to restore 
NuGet packages that are used in the F# scripts. Then you can open the `fsx` files and
follow the script. You might need to update paths, or copy the `data` folder to `C:\data`. The `WorldBank` project
can be started in an usual way (F5) - it starts a local web server that hosts the generated JavaScript.

You can ignore the `start` folder,
which contains the initial source code used in the talk.
