Type provider treasure hunt
---------------------------

### Running the samples

Download the `treasure.zip` file. In most cases, you need to right click on the file after downloading
it and [click the Unblock button](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile.aspx). Otherwise, the
type providers will fail to load and you'll get weird error messages. Then you can unzip the file, open
the solution and have fun in `Treasure.fsx`!

### Talk abstract 

In this hands-on session we’ll have fun with F# type providers! In most programming languages, accessing data is pain – you have to parse data into some object and then dynamically extract the value you are interested in, or you need to use some external tool for code generation.

Type provides completely change the story by integrating data directly in the language. This makes it possible to access a wide range of data sources in a type-safe way with full IDE integration. In this session, we’ll look at type providers for CSV, XML and JSON files, accessing data from online stores like Freebase and WorldBank and calling REST based and WSDL based web services. As a bonus, we’ll have a quick look at FunScript, which makes it possible to compile to write single-page JavaScript apps using F# and just another type provider!

The session will be a mix of demos and interactive tasks. We’ll finish with a treasure hunt competition where you’ll have to find clues from 6 different data sources and combine them to find a secret phrase!
