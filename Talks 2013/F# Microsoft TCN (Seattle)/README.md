How F# Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data 
-------------------------------------------------

### Running the samples

To run the samples, open the solution in the `code` folder (or download the contents of the
folder in the `code.zip` file) and build the solution once to 
restore NuGet packages that are used in the F# scripts. Then open the `fsx` files and
run them line-by-line in F# interactive. The MovieDatabase project can be compiled and
started in standard way (F5).
